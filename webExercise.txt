What happens when you type a URL in a browser?
Your browser will use DNS(Domain Name System) by converting a readable URL into an IP address.
Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers(info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)
The server sends the response typically HTML with a status code. If it was sucessful it will be 200.
The browser makes a DOM from that HTML and finds any other resources needed(images, CSS, Javascript, etc)
The browser makes seperate HTTP reuqest for those resources and receives response from the server for each.
